# Halo3-ODST-hackcard
my first attempt at PCB design for the hackclub solder YSWS

This is my Hackathon card, I designed it around the shape of the halo 3:ODST (Oribtal Drop Shock Troopers) droppods. I chose this design because halo 3: ODST is one of if not my favorite game. This card uses a photoresistor to change the brightness of an LED as the ambient light level changes.
