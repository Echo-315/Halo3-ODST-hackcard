# Halo3-ODST-hackcard
My first time at PCB design (using kicad and overall) for the Hackclub solder YSWS

This is my Hackathon card. I designed it around the shape of the Halo 3: ODST (Orbital Drop Shock Troopers) drop pods. I chose this design because Halo 3: ODST is one of, if not my favorite game. This card uses a photoresistor to change the brightness of an LED as the ambient light level changes.

# BOM
1x 220 Ohm resistor 1x 4.7k Ohm resistor 1x 2N3904 transistor 1x CR2032 battery cell 1x GL5528 photoresistor 1x 5mm LED
